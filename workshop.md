# Introduction

*intro goes here*

## Modalities

- Total workshop duration is 2-3 days.
- Each module is accompanied with technical explanation of the Fabric Real-Time Intelligence component being used in the tutorial.
- Without the accompanied explanation, the tutorial can be completed in 1-2 days.

## Prerequisites

To get starated with this training and to understand the baseline of the Real-Time Intelligence suite of services from Microsoft Fabric, it is expected of the audience to have the following certifications:

- [DP-600 Microsoft Certified: Fabric Analytics Engineer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/fabric-analytics-engineer-associate/?practice-assessment-type=certification)
- [DP-700 Microsoft Certified: Fabric Data Engineer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/fabric-data-engineer-associate/?practice-assessment-type=certification)
- [Microsoft Applied Skills: Implement a Real-Time Intelligence solution with Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/applied-skills/implement-a-real-time-intelligence-solution-with-microsoft-fabric/)

This training will not help you understand the basics of the suite, and it will start of from the above mentioned knowledge level.

## Overview of the content

The content is built from 12 modules, spanning ingestion of data, manipulation of data when needed using the KQL language and visualize & analyze data using KQL, Real-Time Dashboards and Power BI, CI/CD and architectural approaches, Security and Networking.

1. Connectors
2. Real-Time Hub
3. Ingestion
4. Analytics
5. Dashboards
6. Rules (Activator)
7. Actions
8. AI + Copilot
9. Data modelling
10. Security
11. Networking
12. CI/CD and ALM

Each module has the same overall structure:

| Structure | Content |
|------------|---------|
| 1. Introduction to the module | Gives the fly-in to the module, the content and the business value of the module and area of RTI. |
| 2. Architectural deep dive | Introduces the module and the connection to the rest of the RTI suite in Microsoft Fabric. Also contains elements on how the architecture could work in conjunction with other parts of the RTI service. |
| 3. Technical deep dive | Dive into the whereabouts of the service. Seen from the backend, with a deep technical walktthrough of how things are working behind the scenes and what makes the specific part of the service connect with the rest. |
| 4. Implementations | How should the specific part of the service be implemented and what to look out for when working with it. Also a deep walktrough of the details in functionality and outcome of the service. |
| 5. Troubleshooting | How to read error messages and error codes. How to debug issues. How to best help Microsoft support in case of need. |
| 6. Orchestration and optimization | How does the service best fit with an entire architecture around orchestration, how to execute the processes. How to optimize the loads, speeds and querytimes. |
| 7. Schemas and throughout | How to handle schemas in the service and what to know when working with structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. A walkthrough of the limitations, configuration options and whereabouts of throughput |
| 8. Monitoring and pricing | How to monitor the service and find the bottlenecks and other needed information of the performance. A deep learning element on how to calculate and estimate cost of a service and an entire implementation. How to monitor cost and optimize for cost reduction. |
| 9. Hands-on lab | A hands on lab with guides, to try out the specific service and to learn some of the L400 features. |
