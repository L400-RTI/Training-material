# Local Development Workflow

I was curios to see how our traning looks like, so I created a local development workflow that is able to serve the workshop right from your local computer. The prerequisits for this to run is that you have installed the **MOAW Cli** as described [here](https://moaw.dev/workshop/?src=create-workshop%2F&step=2#).

I added a simple PowerShell Script [here](./powershell/CombineMarkdown.ps1) that "compiles" (I know, I know ðŸ¤£) the different files into one single workshop file that you can find [here](./workshop.md).

To start the compilation please just call the PowerShell Script in the main directory of this project like

```powershell
.\powershell\CombineMarkdown.ps1
```

After the "compilation" is done you can start your local MOAW.dev instance with

```powershell
moaw serve '.\workshop.md'
```
