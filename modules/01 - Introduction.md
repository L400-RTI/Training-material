## Module 1 - Introduction to Real-Time Intelligence

### Introduction

Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric is a fully managed, end-to-end platform for ingesting,
processing, analyzing, and acting on streaming data — all in near real time.

It enables organizations to:

- **Capture live data** from sources like IoT devices, logs, files, APIs, and more using Eventstream.
- **Enrich and transform** that data in motion with KQL, Eventstreams, or low-code tools.
- **Detect patterns, anomalies, and threshold conditions** using rules in Activator.
- **Trigger automated actions** across systems (e.g., Power Automate, pipelines, APIs) the moment a business-critical event occurs.

Real-Time Intelligence is deeply integrated with the broader Fabric platform — allowing seamless connectivity with OneLake, Notebooks, Pipelines,
Power BI, and security infrastructure. This gives enterprises a unified foundation for real-time operational
analytics, anomaly detection, aleReal-Time Intelligenceng, and automated decisioning.

In short: Real-Time Intelligence empowers you to go from data-in-motion to action-in-motion.

### Architectural deep dive

Real-Time Intelligence is not a siloed service—it is a tightly integrated layer within the broader
Microsoft Fabric unified data platform, designed to support continuous intelligence pipelines across
structured and unstructured data streams.

At the architectural level, Real-Time Intelligence is composed of several interlocking components:

#### 1. Data Sources (Streaming & Batch)

The architecture supports a wide range of streaming and batch data sources:

- Streaming: Kafka, MQTT, Azure Event Hubs, IoT Hub, Azure Data Explorer, PostgreSQL, Cosmos DB, and others.
- Batch: Ingested and orchestrated via Data Factory, which feeds both Lakehouse and Eventhouse layers.

#### 2. Eventstream – The Streaming Ingestion Gateway

Eventstream acts as the unified real-time ingestion layer:

- Connects to live data sources with low latency
- Filters, parses, and enriches data in motion
- Routes data simultaneously to destinations such as Eventhouse, Real-time Dashboards, and Activator

#### 3. Eventhouse – Layered Storage & Processing

With Eventhouse you can build:

- Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers for progressive data refinement
- Update policies to process data as they are ingested into the KQL-Databases
- Materialized views (MV) for near-real-time queryability
- Integration with OneLake and Query Accelerated Shortcuts for high-performance access

#### 4. Machine Learning Integration

The platform supports training and real-time scoring of ML models:

- Models consume streaming or batch data
- Real-time inference is embedded directly into the processing pipeline via Eventhouse

#### 5. Real-Time Visualization and Analytics

- Power BI and Real-Time Dashboards provide instant visibility into data flowing through
  Eventstream and Eventhouse
- Data is queried directly via DirectQuery, eliminating the need for duplication

#### 6. Activator – Action Engine and Automation Layer

Activator is the execution engine for real-time actions:

- Listens for triggers from Reflex detection rules or Eventstream patterns
- Executes downstream actions: Power Automate flows, REST API calls, email, Teams alerts, and more
- Supports composable rules, stateful evaluation, and alert suppression strategies

#### 7. Foundational Platform Integration

All Real-Time Intelligence components are built on core Fabric foundations:

- OneLake for unified data storage across batch and streaming workloads
- Real-Time Hub as a logical fabric-wide orchestration layer
- AI and Copilot Agents for intelligent assistance and automation enrichment

#### Architectural Highlights

- **Integrated Lakehouse and Streaming:** Combines traditional Lakehouse architecture with real-time stream
  processing
- **Natively Fabric:** All services are fully managed and deeply connected across the Fabric ecosystem
- **Streaming-to-Action:** Built for low-latency, high-value automated responses
- **End-to-End Observability:** Real-time dashboards and ML scoring close the loop from raw data to business decision

Real-Time Intelligence workloads are capacity-based, ensuring predictable performance and cost control across tenant- or
workspace-scoped environments. It supports multi-tenant, cross-workspace, and multi-sink streaming
architectures, making it a good fit for enterprise-wide observability, monitoring, and automation solutions.

### Technical deep dive

Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric is more than a data flow — it’s a system of reactive engines working together to process, detect, and act on data in milliseconds. This section introduces the internal workings behind the core components to help you understand why things behave the way they do. This is only a short summary.
These topics are covered in the different Modules more in depth

#### Eventstream Internals

**Core Focus:** Buffering, parallelization, schema evolution, and latency management

- Ingested data from streaming sources is processed via paReal-Time Intelligencetioned pipelines, often aligned to source paReal-Time Intelligencetions (e.g., Kafka topics).

- Eventstream introduces a controlled buffer delay (typically ~10 seconds) to enable multi-sink routing and enrichment.

- Supports schema inference and evolution, allowing downstream systems to adapt to changes in the payload shape.

- Event delivery is parallelized but respects ordering guarantees per paReal-Time Intelligencetion.

**Implication:** Changes in source schemas, burst traffic, or improperly filtered data can delay or disrupt downstream pipelines.

#### Eventhouse Mechanics

**Core Focus:** Update policies, ingestion windows, materialized views

- Data ingested by Eventstream to the Bronze layer can be written to Silver or Gold layers via update policies.
- Ingestion into Eventhouse supports near real-time materialized views (MV) to precompute aggregates.
- Ingestion windows define how often new records are committed and visible — typically every few seconds.

**Implication:** Knowing how Eventhouse batches and evaluates data is essential for synchronizing analytics and trigger points with actual data availability.

#### Activator

**Core Focus:** Trigger resolution, delay models, retries, and action targeting

- Activator receives event context from Reflex including all rule-evaluated fields and metadata.
- Internally, Activator applies:

  - Suppression logic (e.g., “no more than one alert per 60s”)
  - Concurrency controls (to avoid over-firing actions)
  - Execution retries for transient failures (e.g., webhook timeouts)

- Supports multiple action targets, including notebooks, pipelines, Power Automate, and webhooks.

**Implication:** Misconfigured rules or actions can overload endpoints or cause noisy aleReal-Time Intelligenceng without proper debounce logic.

#### State Handling in Reflex

**Core Focus:** Stateless vs. stateful evaluation, cooldowns, suppression

- Stateless rules match raw values (e.g., value > 100) — evaluated on every event.
- Stateful rules track transitions (e.g., value DECREASES, EXIT RANGE, or absence over time).
- Reflex maintains in-memory state per tracked entity, e.g., per device_id or bikepoint_id.
- Cooldown timers and alert thresholds reduce false positives and spamming.

**Implication:** Understanding how state is maintained and when it resets is crucial to correct and efficient pattern detection.

#### Action Routing

**Core Focus:** Execution paths, targeting logic, and custom extensions

- Activator can execute multiple action types depending on business needs:
  - Built-in Power Automate integration
  - REST POST to web services or Teams
  - Trigger Fabric Pipelines or Notebooks
- Action routing can dynamically include payload data, headers, and even computed values.
- Soon: Direct Web API integration to define fully custom actions.

**Implication:** Building enterprise-grade reactions means understanding what each action path supports in terms of latency, retries, and payload structure.

#### Performance Tuning Knobs

**Core Focus:** Throughput, suppression, and buffer configuration

- Eventstream allows tuning:
  - Buffer sizes
  - Output frequency
  - Filtering complexity
- Reflex rules can include alert frequency controls and aggregation windows
- Activator supports deduplication, throttling windows, and max concurrency settings

**Implication:** Understanding these levers helps reduce noise, optimize cost, and improve SLAs.

#### Capacity Impact

Core Focus: Real-Time Intelligence’s consumption of Fabric Capacity Units (FCUs)

- Each component consumes compute based on:
- Data volume and frequency
- Rule complexity
- Action volume and concurrency

Eventstream and Activator scale with event velocity, while Eventhouse depends on query concurrency and storage tiering.

**Implication:** Real-Time Intelligence capacity must be planned with sustained and peak loads in mind — especially for high-volume streaming applications.

### Implementations

Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence (Real-Time Intelligence) is engineered for enterprise-grade data streaming, event detection, and low-latency action pipelines. But design elegance on paper doesn’t guarantee operational success. Implementations in the real world surface challenges that are not immediately visible from documentation or demos.

This course places special emphasis on implementations—not just how the services work, but how they behave under scale, complex orchestration, and production constraints.

#### What "Implementation" Means in Real-Time Intelligence

- Designing event ingestion pipelines that handle bursty, high-volume, and diverse data reliably
- Authoring rules and detections that avoid false positives and alert spamming
- Managing state, schema evolution, and windowing in streaming logic
- Triggering actions (notebooks, pipelines, alerts) in a controlled, idempotent, and performant manner
- Embedding Real-Time Intelligence into broader data estate orchestration (Synapse, Power BI, Microsoft Purview, etc.)

#### Why It Matters

In current partner engagements, we’ve observed that incorrect or naïve implementations are a leading cause of:

- Production outages due to misfiring rules or underprovisioned capacities
- Delayed detection due to improper windowing or federation configuration
- Unnecessary costs from unfiltered ingestion or redundant triggers

Getting implementation right is not a bonus—it’s foundational to making Real-Time Intelligence reliable, scalable, and cost-effective.

#### What to Expect in This Course

You’ll learn not only how to configure services, but also:

- When to use them—and when not to
- How to structure stateful logic for durable aleReal-Time Intelligenceng
- How to monitor behavior in-flight and post-execution
- Where common pitfalls lie, and how to avoid or mitigate them

We’ll provide implementation blueprints and walkthroughs drawn from real customer architectures, internal Microsoft learnings, and validated best practices from the product engineering team.

### Troubleshooting

#### Real-Time Systems Fail Differently

In real-time architectures, failures don’t always come with clear error messages. Instead, they manifest as **missing events**, **delayed detections**, **duplicate triggers**, or **silent breakdowns in orchestration**.

Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence (Real-Time Intelligence) is a powerful suite—but also a distributed, low-latency system where:

- Data flows continuously across services (Eventstream → Eventhouse → Activator/Visualisation)
- Latency thresholds are tight
- Observability requires intentional design

Because of this, troubleshooting in Real-Time Intelligence is not an isolated phase—it’s an architectural concern that must be addressed from the outset.

#### Why Troubleshooting is Foundational

This course integrates troubleshooting as a core skillset throughout every module. For senior architects and data engineers, success with Real-Time Intelligence doesn’t just mean getting pipelines running - it means keeping them stable, traceable, and observable in production.

You’ll explore:

- How to diagnose lag across ingestion, federation, and evaluation layers
- How to trace issues across services, from Eventstream failures to delayed triggers in downstream systems
- How to handle schema mismatches, data gaps, and unexpected bursts
- How to read and act on system diagnostics, including metrics, logs, and rule previews

#### The Cost of Poor Troubleshooting Readiness

In real-world deployments, we’ve seen:

- Pipelines silently stall because stream paReal-Time Intelligencetions were dropped upstream
- Rules misfire due to misunderstood time windows or null handling
- BI dashboards display stale data because of overlooked ingestion lag
- Support escalations take days due to lack of trace-level observability

This course gives you the tools and mindset to design for debuggability from day one—avoiding the cost of reactive firefighting.

#### What You'll Learn

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to:

- Design Real-Time Intelligence architectures that are traceable end-to-end
- Build monitoring into every component—from Eventstreams to KQL DBs to actions
- Use built-in and external tools (e.g., Log Analytics, Monitor, Diagnostic Logs) to detect and resolve failures
- Provide clear signals and telemetry when engaging with Microsoft support or operations teams

The best Real-Time Intelligence systems are not just fast—they’re also introspectable, resilient, and transparent when things go wrong.

### Orchestration and optimization

#### Beyond Configuration: Architecting for Flow and Efficiency

In Real-Time Intelligence, services like Eventstream, KQL DB, Real-Time Hub and Activatorare powerful individually - but they only deliver business value when orchestrated into coherent, low-latency dataflows.

This course emphasizes not just how to configure components, but how to architect and optimize them holistically - so that data moves with purpose, triggers fire with precision, and costs stay predictable at scale.

#### The Real-Time Intelligence Orchestration Model

Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence enables event-driven workflows, but orchestration must be explicitly designed to ensure:

- Data arrives at the right processing layer (e.g., KQL DB vs. pipeline vs. alert rule)
- Actions execute only when preconditions are satisfied
- State transitions are respected, especially in temporal logic
- Downstream systems (Power BI, Synapse, Teams) are triggered with the right payload, at the right time

You’ll learn how to use tools like:

- Eventstream filters and paReal-Time Intelligencetions to direct traffic efficiently
- KQL queries with temporal windows and joins to correlate real-time data
- Rule federation and grouping to reduce trigger noise
- Power Automate and Notebooks to create precise, governed actions

#### Optimization is Not Optional

Real-time systems operate under tight latency budgets and throughput ceilings. Poor optimization can result in:

- Delayed detections (e.g., alerts fire after the event has passed)
- Unnecessary compute costs (e.g., evaluating every message in every rule)
- Overloaded KQL DBs due to unbatched inserts or joins across high-velocity streams
- Stream starvation or backpressure, causing missed detections

Optimization in Real-Time Intelligence isn’t a one-time tuning—it’s a continuous design mindset. You’ll explore:

- How to model throughput across ingestion and federation
- How to structure queries and pipelines for sub-second latency
- How to monitor execution metrics and system counters
- How to right-size capacity and workload placement across Fabric items

#### What You'll Learn

Throughout the course, you will develop a deep understanding of how to:

- Design end-to-end orchestrated pipelines across Real-Time Intelligence components
- Minimize latency, contention, and false positives through query and rule optimization
- Structure workloads for observability, testability, and reliability
- Estimate and control resource consumption and cost

In Real-Time Intelligence, performance is not a luxury - it’s a design requirement. And orchestration is where performance becomes architecture.

### Schemas and throughput

#### The Overlooked Foundations of Real-Time Intelligence Architecture

In Real-Time Intelligence (Real-Time Intelligence), much of the architectural complexity lies not in configuration, but in understanding how data structure (schemas) and data velocity (throughput) impact the system’s behavior from ingestion to action.

Poor assumptions about these two dimensions are a leading cause of production issues in real-world Real-Time Intelligence deployments. This course tackles both topics as core architectural considerations—not as side effects of upstream decisions.

#### Why Schemas Matter in Real Time

Real-Time Intelligence services - Eventstream, Eventhouse, Activator, Real-Time Hub - depend on explicit schema understanding to parse, correlate, and act on data. But in modern streaming systems, schemas are rarely fixed:

- JSON payloads evolve
- Fields become nullable or disappear
- New attributes are added midstream

If your architecture assumes schema stability, you’re building a fragile system.

You’ll learn:

- How schema drift can break pipelines silently
- How semi-structured payloads (e.g. nested JSON) impact parsing and filtering
- How to manage schema alignment across ingestion, detection, and action layers
- When to use schema-on-read (e.g., KQL parse_json) vs. schema-on-write (e.g., structured Eventstream)

Schema is not just a developer concern—it’s a first-order operational dependency.

#### Throughput: The Invisible Limit

Fabric Real-Time Intelligence is built for speed, but every component - Eventstream, KQL DB, Pipelines, Notebooks - has practical throughput boundaries. Many implementations fail to model:

- Ingest rate per paReal-Time Intelligencetion
- Rule evaluation cost under event spikes
- Memory pressure in downstream aggregations

The result? Delays, throttling, and even silent data loss.

This course teaches you how to:

- Benchmark and estimate throughput end-to-end
- Identify bottlenecks in ingestion, federation, and action layers
- Use tools (e.g., Eventstream diagnostics, Monitor metrics, KQL DMVs) to trace pressure points
- Optimize rule complexity and reduce fan-out in streaming pipelines

Real-time success isn't about speed alone—it’s about sustained, observable, and predictable throughput.

#### What You'll Learn

Throughout this course, you’ll develop the skills to:

- Architect for schema evolution while maintaining system stability
- Design for throughput-aware processing across Fabric Real-Time Intelligence components
- Choose formats (CSV, JSON, Avro) based on latency and fidelity trade-offs
- Prevent schema mismatches and stream overloads through early validation and instrumentation

Schema defines what data is. Throughput defines how much and how fast. Together, they define whether it works.

### Monitoring and pricing

#### Real-Time Systems Demand Real-Time Insight

In Real-Time Intelligence, what you can’t observe, you can’t control—and what you can’t control, you can’t trust in production.

Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence enables sophisticated low-latency pipelines, but with that power comes the need for rigorous **monitoring** and **cost governance**. This course treats both as non-negotiable pillars of a production-grade design.

#### Monitoring: Observability is Architecture

Monitoring in Real-Time Intelligence is not just about uptime - it’s about:

- Latency detection across ingestion, evaluation, and action layers
- Event gaps (e.g., heartbeat failures, missing paReal-Time Intelligencetions)
- Trigger audits (what fired, when, with what payload)
- Data quality diagnostics (nulls, schema errors, outliers)

Yet many implementations defer observability until after deployment, resulting in:

- Blind spots during alert storms or missing events
- Difficulty debugging false positives or failed triggers
- Lack of evidence when engaging with Microsoft Support

You’ll learn how to:

- Leverage built-in diagnostics in Eventstream, Activator, and Real-Time Hub
- Use Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and diagnostic logs for telemetry aggregation
- Build live dashboards in Power BI for Real-Time Intelligence health monitoring
- Trace a single event across the full Real-Time Intelligence pipeline using correlation IDs and logging hooks

Monitoring is not a dashboard—it’s a design mindset that enables production trust.

#### Pricing: Real-Time Costs Are Continuous

Real-Time Intelligence workloads are event-driven, continuous, and potentially high-volume. Without cost awareness, teams risk:

- Unexpected consumption spikes (e.g., unfiltered streams, over-triggered actions)
- Wasteful rule evaluation on irrelevant paReal-Time Intelligencetions
- Over-provisioning of capacity in pipelines and KQL DBs

This course trains you to design with cost efficiency in mind from the start:

- Estimate per-event cost across ingestion, federation, and action
- Understand how capacity SKUs, Real-Time Intelligence item types, and rule frequency affect pricing
- Use cost telemetry and Fabric billing APIs to monitor spend in near-real-time
- Apply cost optimization patterns (e.g., preview mode testing, selective rule targeting, action throttling)

Real-Time Intelligence cost is not just a budget item - it’s a feedback loop for architectural efficiency.

#### What You’ll Learn

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Build fully observable Real-Time Intelligence pipelines with end-to-end diagnostics
- Detect anomalies and degradations before they affect downstream systems
- Predict and monitor event-driven cost behavior at scale
- Make design trade-offs that balance latency, fidelity, and financial impact

In production-grade Real-Time Intelligence systems, what gets monitored gets trusted—and what gets priced gets optimized.
